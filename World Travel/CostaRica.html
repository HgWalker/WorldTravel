    <h1>Costa Rica</h1>

    <p>Costa Rica is a  rugged, rainforested Central American country with coastlines on the Caribbean  and Pacific. Though its capital, San Jose, is home to cultural institutions  like the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum, Costa Rica is known for its beaches,  volcanoes, and biodiversity. Roughly a quarter of its area is made up of  protected jungle, teeming with wildlife including spider monkeys and quetzal  birds.</p>
    <p>The Peaceful Soul of  Central America<br>
      If marketing experts  could draw up an ideal destination, Costa Rica might be it. The 'rich coast'  has earned its name and stands apart from its Central American neighbors on the  cutting edge of so many trends: surfing, farm-to-table restaurants, and sustainable  tourism. Developing infrastructure is balanced by green energy such as wind and  hydro. One of the world's most biodiverse countries, with half a million  species – from insects to the giant anteaters that devour them – it also  protects one-quarter of its wild lands through law.</p>
    <p>Outdoor Adventures<br>
      Rainforest hikes and  brisk high-altitude trails, rushing white-water rapids and warm-water,  world-class surfing: Costa Rica offers a dizzying suite of outdoor adventures  in every shape and size – from the squeal-inducing rush of a canopy zipline to  a sun-dazed afternoon at the beach. National parks allow visitors to glimpse  life in both rainforest and cloud forest, simmering volcanoes offer  otherworldly vistas, and reliable surf breaks are suited to beginners and  experts alike. Can&rsquo;t decide? Don&rsquo;t worry: given the country&rsquo;s size, you can  plan a relatively short trip that includes it all.</p>
