    <h1>GREECE - ANCIENT CIVILIZATION </h1>

    <p>Greece is a country in  southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean and Ionian  seas. Influential in ancient times, it's often called the cradle of Western  civilization. Athens, its capital, retains landmarks including the 5th-century  B.C. Acropolis citadel with the Parthenon temple. Greece is also known for its  beaches, from the black sands of Santorini to the party resorts of Mykonos.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Dion is Macedonia&rsquo;s  ancient holy city, which is located on the foot of Mt Olympus at a 5km distance  from the <a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/mainland/the_shoreline_at_the_foot_of_mt_olympus">shores</a> of Pieria. It was the most significant worship spot in antiquity where  sacrifices to the Olympian Gods used to take place. This is where King Philip  won battles and Alexander the Great offered sacrifices before his expedition to  the Persian territory. The area is renowned and much visited for its  archaeological site. A large fortified ancient city, temples, theatres, a  stadium and cemeteries were unearthed and they serve as evidence that the area  was inhabited for more than 1,000 years (5th c. BC up to 5th c. AD). The Dion  thermae were built around 200 AD and are most impressive.</p>

      <p>The Olympus National  Park has wonderful hiking routes you can follow within natural settings of  great beauty. This is Greece&rsquo;s first National Park (declared so in 1938). It  covers a 45,000 km2 area, and it is home to alpine vegetation, black pine, oak,  rompolÎ¿ (a type of white pine), beech and 1,700 plant species (23 of which are  endemic). In 1981 Mt. Olympus was designated as a UNESCO biosphere reserve.  You&rsquo;ll come across various lodges on the mountain: &ldquo;D. Bountolas&rdquo; (930m alt.),  &ldquo;Sp. Agapitos&rdquo; (2,100m alt.), &ldquo;Chr. Kakalos&rdquo; (2,650m alt.) and &ldquo;G. Apostolidis&rdquo;  (2,100m alt.).<br>
    There are numerous  mountain trails you can explore, the most popular one being the <a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/en/destinations/litochoro">Litochoro</a> - Prionia hiking route that travels through the Enipeas gorge (E4 path). If you  want to extend your excursion, before reaching Prionia you can follow the trail  to Mouson Plateau (2,600m alt.) from Gortsia location and head to higher peaks  from there on.</p>
