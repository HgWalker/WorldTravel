    <h1>Ireland </h1>

    <p>Ireland is an island in  the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North  Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest  island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest  on Earth.</p>
    <p>And the secrets are  everywhere. Every cairn has a story, every castle turret has a tale, every hill  may hide heroic sagas. Ask the people you meet and you will hear them tell of  the legends, triumph and sometimes tragedy that whirl around its round towers,  opulent mansions and prehistoric monuments.</p>
    <p>Welcome to Dublin, a  lively capital city that&rsquo;s as intimate as a village and as friendly as your  local Irish pub. With its seamless blend of classic visitor sights, excellent  social scene and the natural playgrounds of Dublin Bay and the Dublin Mountains  framing it on all sides, this laidback city is an adventure in itself.</p>
<p>Want to catch some local talent? Make your way to a gig. Feeling hungry?  Indulge in old Dublin favourites at <a href="http://thewoollenmills.com/">The Woollen Mills</a>.  And if you want to slow the pace a little, stroll the city's charming coastal  villages like <a href="https://www.ireland.com/en-us/what-is-available/sightseeing/destinations/republic-of-ireland/dublin/articles/dublin-coastal-towns-and-villages/">Howth or Dalkey</a> or follow one of the <a href="https://www.ireland.com/en-us/what-is-available/touring-holidays/walking-tours/destinations/republic-of-ireland/dublin/dublin-city/articles/dublin-discovery-trails-app/">Dublin Discovery  Trails</a> to uncover the city's secrets. You see, Dublin is all about  the muse behind the music, the craic (fun) of the comedy, the intimate feel of  this urban hub. And, of course, the people! Dublin has been named Europe's  friendliest city twice by TripAdvisor for good reason. So grab a pint, strike  up a conversation, and settle in for the experience of a lifetime. <p/>
