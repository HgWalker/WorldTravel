    <h1>Australia </h1>

    <p>Australia, officially  the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland  of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller  islands. It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest  country by total area.</p>
    <p>Sydney is the first stop  on many Australian itineraries, and for good reason. It's an inviting blend of  the exhilarating and easygoing. You can find excitement in the city, but drive  just a few kilometres and you'll hit the golden sand of famous beaches like  Bondi and Manly. Plus, with endless nature at its doorstep, Sydney is the  starting point for day trips serving up fresh air, unique flavours and locals  who know a thing or two about living life to the fullest.</p>
    <p>Home to diverse marine  life of the most vivid colours, the Great Barrier Reef offers the opportunity  for great adventure, both in luxury and on a budget. Whether you explore the  stunning Whitsunday Islands, trek the ancient Daintree Rainforest or relax on  luxurious tropical islands such as Hayman and Lizard, a day on the reef is all  about the unforgettable nature that surrounds you. Adopt Australia's easygoing  attitude when you island-hop, or stay in one of the many coastal getaways such  as Cairns, Airlie Beach, Hervey Bay, Mission Beach and Port Douglas.</p>
    <p>The Red Centre is an  extraordinary landscape of desert plains, weathered mountain ranges, rocky  gorges and some of Aboriginal Australia's most sacred sites, including&nbsp;<a href="https://northernterritory.com/uluru-and-surrounds/destinations/uluru-ayers-rock">Uluru</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.australia.com/en-us/places/alice-springs-and-surrounds/guide-to-kata-tjuta.html">Kata Tjuá¹¯a</a>.&nbsp;Floating in an outback  waterhole, dining under a starry sky while being serenaded by didgeridoo, and  watching the world's most famous rock change colours at dawn and dusk are just  some of the Red Centre's only-in-Australia experiences.</p>
